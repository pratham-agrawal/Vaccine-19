In March 2020 the world was hit by a massive pandemic caused by the Covid-19. Since, then scientists from all around the world have been working tirelessly to make a vaccine in order to combat the spread of the deadly virus.
Unfortunately, the roll out of the vaccine is bound to be slow at the start, and it is vital that the government places distribution centres in the highest priority areas.
Our group decided to tackle this problem and create an app that requests user data such as job type, location, and age. This information will then be utilized by an algorithm we created in order to create a heatmap of the most essential placement points of distribution centres.
Another problem we had seen complaints about were buggy and slow apps for the sign up for vaccines. This is a significant issue for the elderly population, who are not well versed with complicated applications. They are also at high risk from Covid-19 and are a priority for early vaccinations. 
With the use of our app, we hope to further implement scheduling and smooth UI for simplistic vaccine distribution. This will give the elderly population easier acess to the vaccine. Our data collected paired with our algorithm will allow us to identify citizens facing the highest risk and ensure that they are given early acess to vaccines.
